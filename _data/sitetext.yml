     award: "April Wyncott Awarded a 2022 Dorothy Donnelly Service Award at the U.S. Masters Swimming Annual Meeting in Denver, Colorado"
     image: "assets/img/april_award.png"
     text: "April Wyncott started swimming and volunteering for the Michigan LMSC in 1987. Thru the years, she relocated to Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and eventually back to Michigan. <br>
    In March 2020, when the City of Ann Arbor closed all of their pools and  cases of Covid-19 were rising in Michigan, it was questionable as to whether swimmers could be safe in the pool. USMS Ann Arbor Masters Swimmer, April Wyncott could not accept the thought of closed pools, not swimming, and losing the fitness level and comradery of the group. Using her 30+ years of public health and healthcare administration experience, April left no stone unturned to help impact the health of Ann Arbor Masters Swimming members, reduce the emotional stress and social isolation that came with the statewide lock-downs, and enhance the wellness of the group.

    April reached out to Coach Don Swalwell and teammates Sophie Stepke and Jack Coffey to write up the first-ever Ann Arbor Masters Swimming Covid-19 Safety Plan based on CDC and USA Swimming guidance.
    <br>
    After that, April registered Ann Arbor Masters Swimming with USMS and MI Masters as a workout group
    <br>
    On June 16, 2020, following strict Covid-19 guidelines and lane limitations, thirty-five Ann Arbor Masters Swimming swimmers began swimming outdoors at the Georgetown Country Club pool.
    <br>
    April is currently President of Ann Arbor Masters Swimming, Inc. and works to ensure that swimmers remain in the water and maintain a high level of health, wellness and competitive fitness. The group continues to grow and welcomes swimmers of all levels to be part of Ann Arbor Masters Swimming."
