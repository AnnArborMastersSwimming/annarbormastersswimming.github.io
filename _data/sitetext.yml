    title: "About us"
    text: "Ann Arbor Masters Swimming (A2MS) has been in existence for the past 
30 years located in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  There has been various coaches, 
pools and accommodations throughout the years.  Our workout group consists 
of every level of swimmer from beginners to college-level swimmers and we 
welcome all (post Covid-19). Our team community is unsurpassed with members 
branching out to group triathlons and/or lake swims; national USMS and State 
MI Masters swimming meets; swim meet road trips; community service and horse-farm 
bonfires and get-togethers. Our swimming numbers have recently been restricted 
due to the Covid-19 limitations. We hope to welcome everyone back to the pool soon.<br>
